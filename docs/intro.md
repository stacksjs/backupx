# A Better Developer Experience

> A TypeScript Starter Kit that will help you bootstrap your next project without minimal opinion.

# bun-ts-starter

This is an opinionated TypeScript Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next Bun package.

## Get Started

It's rather simple to get your package development started:

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
bunx degit stacksjs/ts-starter my-pkg
cd my-pkg

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
bun i # install all deps
bun run build # builds the library for production-ready use

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
bun run release # automates git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
```

_Check out the package.json scripts for more commands._

# Introduction

backupx is a comprehensive TypeScript backup library designed specifically for the Bun runtime. It provides a unified solution for backing up databases and files with modern JavaScript features, full type safety, and production-ready performance.

## What is backupx?

backupx is a TypeScript-first backup library that supports:

- **Database Backups**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL with native Bun drivers
- **File & Directory Backups**: Individual files or entire directory trees
- **Smart Compression**: Optional gzip compression with efficiency reporting
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup based on count or age
- **CLI & Library**: Use programmatically or via command-line interface

## Why Choose backupx?

### üöÄ Built for Bun Runtime

Unlike other backup solutions, backupx is specifically designed for Bun's high-performance JavaScript runtime. It leverages Bun's native database drivers and fast I/O operations.

### üîß TypeScript-First Design

Every API is fully typed with comprehensive type safety. You get excellent IntelliSense support and compile-time error checking.

```ts
import { BackupManager, BackupType } from 'backupx'

const config: BackupConfig = {
  verbose: true,
  databases: [
    {
      type: BackupType.SQLITE,
      name: 'my-app-db',
      path: './database.sqlite',
    }
  ],
  files: [
    {
      name: 'uploads',
      path: './uploads',
      compress: true,
      exclude: ['*.tmp', 'cache/*'],
    }
  ]
}
```

### ‚ö° High Performance

- Streaming compression reduces memory usage
- Async operations prevent blocking
- Native Bun drivers for maximum speed
- Minimal overhead with optimized algorithms

### üéØ Production Ready

- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive test suite (77 tests, 324 assertions)
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Detailed logging and monitoring

## Key Features

### Database Support

- **SQLite**: Direct file-based backup with schema and data
- **PostgreSQL**: Connection string or object configuration
- **MySQL**: Full schema and data backup support

### File Operations

- **Individual Files**: Backup specific files with metadata preservation
- **Directory Trees**: Recursive backup with filtering
- **Compression**: Optional gzip with size reporting
- **Filtering**: Include/exclude patterns with glob support

### Management Features

- **Retention Policies**: Count-based and age-based cleanup
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed progress and error reporting
- **Configuration**: Flexible TypeScript configuration files
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line usage with compiled binaries

## Use Cases

### Web Application Backups

Perfect for backing up both your database and uploaded files:

```ts
const webAppBackup: BackupConfig = {
  databases: [
    { type: BackupType.SQLITE, name: 'app-db', path: './app.db' }
  ],
  files: [
    { name: 'uploads', path: './public/uploads' },
    { name: 'config', path: './config.json' }
  ],
  retention: { count: 10, maxAge: 30 }
}
```

### Development Snapshots

Quickly backup your development environment:

```ts
const devBackup: BackupConfig = {
  databases: [
    { type: BackupType.POSTGRESQL, name: 'dev-db', connection: 'postgres://...' }
  ],
  files: [
    { name: 'src', path: './src', exclude: ['node_modules/*', '*.log'] }
  ]
}
```

### CI/CD Integration

Automate backups in your deployment pipeline:

```bash
# Install globally
bun add -g backupx

# Run backup
backups start --verbose
```

## Getting Started

Ready to start backing up your data? Check out the [Installation Guide](/install) to get backupx set up in your project.

## Architecture

backupx is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Engine**: `BackupManager` orchestrates all operations
- **Database Modules**: Separate modules for each database type
- **File Modules**: Specialized handlers for files and directories
- **Compression Engine**: Streaming gzip compression
- **Retention Manager**: Automatic cleanup and maintenance
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line wrapper around the core library

Each module is independently tested and can be used separately if needed.
